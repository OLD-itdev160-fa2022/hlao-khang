            Now as you can see, this is the most primitive of homes, a plot of land. Rid yourself of civilization things like 
            kitchens, bathrooms, and bedrooms and enjoy nature like our ancestors did! The family in this picture might not 
            be included along with the plot of land once bought. They will be there when you consider buying it though.

            <p>There is nothing like living on a plot of land. I haven't found a place to bathe in 3 months!</p>

            <p>While there exists a many variety of homes in which one might pertain an interest to, nothing is comparable or 
                even remotely as secure, comfortable, and homely as a plot of land.

            Now, if you don't love a natural home found in the plot of land, perhaps you might prefer the modern home! The modern 
            home comes with it, an infestation of cockroaches, mice, and humans. It truly encapsulates the wonder of humankind and 
            their abilities.

            <p>Hi! My name's Human N Steve and I truly have enjoyed the modern home. There's no going wrong with the modern home. 
                I just love the mice, the cockroaches, and all the human infestations that come with the modern home.

            <p>Hi, I'm Human's brother and I just had to share my experience as well. I've had so much fun observing and experimenting 
                with these infestations found in the modern home. As of right now, I've been very interested in the new found infestation 
                called maggots. It's been such an amazing time!
